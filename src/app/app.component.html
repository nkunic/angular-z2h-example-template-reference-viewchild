<h1>Template (Local) Reference Variable & @ViewChild decorator</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Can be added to any element in DOM using # as the first character</li>
  <li>
    Using Template reference we can access DOM elements and their properties
  </li>
  <li>Can be used only in the HTML template</li>
  <li>
    To access in TS component we need to explicitly pass the reference to TS
    trough an event in the HTML template.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sometimes we need to get access to the DOM before we trigger an event in
    HTML. For that type of usecase, we can use @ViewChild
  </li>
</ul>
